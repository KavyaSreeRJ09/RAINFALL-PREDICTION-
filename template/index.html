      <h2>About Rainfall Prediction</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;"><pre>
      -->Rain Prediction is a web app which has a Machine Learning model running at the back. 
      -->The purpose of developing this app is to predict whether it will rain the next day or not. 
      -->This model is based on the Rain Prediction in Australia dataset. 
      <b>More than 80% of Australia has an annual rainfall of less than 600 mm which is less among the all continents other 
      than Antartica which recieves less rainfall.</b>
      A place inland near Lake Eyre would only receive 81 mm of rain annually.The average annual rainfall in the Australian
      desert is low, ranging from 81 to 250 mm.Thunderstorms are relatively common in the region, with an annual average of 
      15 to 20 thunderstorms.The southern parts of Australia get the usual westerly winds and rain-bearing cold fronts that
      come when high - pressuresystems move towards northern Australia during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, 
      though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round.Summers in southern Australia are generally 
      dry and hot with coastal sea breezes.During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry winds from the interior can cause bushfires
      in some southern and eastern states,though most commonly Victoria and New South Wales.The tropical areas of northern 
      Australia have a wet summer because of the monsoon.During "the wet", typically October to April, humid north-westerly 
      winds bring showers and thunderstorms.Occasionally,tropical cyclones can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions,
      which is also likely to reach further inland.

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        The usage of dashboards like these are to have a better understanding about the dataset 
        and also to bring some beautiful insights.Here  images of the dashboard have been attached , 
        in order to have a good visualizations.

        <h2>Models Used</h2>
        <p class="about-content"> <pre>
          Different types of models were tried like 
          --> catboost, 
          --> random forest, 
          --> logistic regression, 
          --> xgboost, 
          --> support vector machines, 
          --> knn, 
          --> naive bayes.
          Out of these catboost, random forest and support vector machines were top 3
          The conclusion were made using classification metrics. roc curve and auc score </p>
